Final project of Data science "Battle of the Neighborhood"

After learning and beenin equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over IBM Data Science's course of two weeks, I will use the Foursquare location data to come up with a problem that I can use the Foursquare location data to solve. 

In a city of Brussels, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would it best to open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where should they setup their office?
